This folder contains the complete experimental data explained in:

> Karakurt, A., Şentürk S., & Serra X. (2016).  [MORTY: A Toolbox for Mode Recognition and Tonic Identification](http://mtg.upf.edu/node/3538). 3rd International Digital Libraries for Musicology Workshop. New York, USA

We host the experimental data in [Zenodo](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.57999) separately due to the file size limitations in github. The hosted zip file includes the folds, features, training data, testing data, the results and the evaluation. You can download the zip and extract it to here.

For a thorough explanation please refer to the [companion page](http://compmusic.upf.edu/node/319) in the CompMusic website and the paper itself. For additional information please contact the authors.
